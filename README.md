# 🌫️ Air Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 🧠 Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for assessing air quality levels across various regions of India. It uses machine learning techniques to analyze pollution data and forecast key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO. The insights can help policymakers take proactive steps to combat air pollution.
